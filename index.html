            <p>The most amazing thing in Portugal are the dishes from the sea. So if you come to Portugal, you have to try grilled fish, cod, seafood, cooked fish and many other choices. The most famous dish is codfish “Bacalhau”, and we have a saying in Portugal: “We have a recipe for codfish for every day of the year”, and it's true! One of the things that we are really proud of is our variety.</p>
