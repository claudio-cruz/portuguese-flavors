<hr>

  - I tested the website in a variety of screen sizes, including full screen, 1200px down, 800px down, 800px down, and 500px down.I confirmed that this project is responsive to all screen sizes.
  - I have confirmed that the form works in all different screen sizes and browsers, requiring the first name, the last name and a valid email. The submit button also works.

### Bugs

- __Solved bugs__
  - When I ran my HTML code in the W3C HTML Validator, I had a bug. It said that in my main section I should remove my closing p tags, but that would break the code. I solved the bug by reorganizing the section and giving more open and closing p tags to the section.
  -  When styling the recipes page, I had a bug when I was lining up two div elements. They had the same padding and the same margin, but the second div was puched down. I fixed this problem by restrocturing the section, putting both divs inside another div and giving the max-width 100% to both.
